In the fourth part of price and trend analysis series, we will look at some of the most popular candlestick patterns used by traders, including the engulfing patterns, star patterns and harami patterns.

This section focuses on the theory of why these patterns form, and also how to identify them in moving markets. Understanding this will enable you to make informed investment decisions in real time.

In this lesson, you will learn

-   How to interpret and trade Engulfing candlestick patterns
-   How to interpret and trade Star candlestick patterns
-   How to interpret and trade Harami candlestick patterns
-   How to trade reversal candlestick patterns

If you look up candlestick patterns in a google search engine, you will be provided with literally hundreds of pages of information related to technical analysis trading patterns, and close to the same amount of different named patterns and functions.

Not to be confused with chart patterns such as double tops and head and shoulders, candlestick patterns usually consist of two to three candles that form in a particular sequence on a candle chart.

Despite the fancy names that many of these patterns have, the reality is that the name of the candlestick patterns are irrelevant, as long as you understand what the pattern represents from a price point perspective.

In our experience, candlestick patterns traded in isolation aren’t nearly as strong as when they are traded with other supporting evidence such as support and resistance, or as part of a larger chart pattern.

When candlestick patterns are traded as part of a bigger picture, they are extremely valuable to not only give a trader quality entry and exit points, but also to confirm key reversal zones.

This lesson will focus on engulfing patterns, star patterns and harami patterns. All three patterns are reversal patterns, and there are countless reversal and continuation patterns out there, but we have found these to be the most consistent and useful to our trading techniques.

**4.1 – Engulfing Patterns**

**4.11 Bullish Engulfing Patterns**

The first of the candle patterns we will look at are the engulfing group.

There are two types of engulfing candle patterns, a bullish engulfing pattern and a bearish engulfing pattern.

Engulfing patterns generally form at the tops and bottoms of markets, and indicate a level of directional control reversal by buyers in a down trending market and by sellers in an up-trending market.

A bullish engulfing pattern forms after a series of bearish candles in a downtrend.

The first part of the bullish engulfing candle will look set to continue the negative advance, and it generally looks like a bearish long range candle.

The second part of the bullish engulfing pattern is a bullish long range candle whose body completely engulfs the previous bearish candle’s body as you can see in the example above.

**4.12 Bearish Engulfing Patterns**

A bearish engulfing pattern forms after a series of bullish candles in an uptrend.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/HZc8X0xdS3iX4mGlajmR)

The first part of the bearish engulfing candle will look set to continue the positive advance, and it generally looks like a bullish long range candle.

The second part of the bearish engulfing pattern is a bearish long range candle whose body completely engulfs the previous bullish candle’s body as you can see in the example above.

In the example below on the EURUSD weekly chart, there is a series of bearish candles forming. At the bottom of the trough, the bullish engulfing pattern forms, where the body of the bearish candle has been completely engulfed by a bullish long range candle.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/qbjD5vHMQEm6xCaBTvTz)

As you can see, the current trend has been reversed by this engulfing pattern, which started an uptrend that lasted 7 months.

At the top of this trend, there is another example of an engulfing pattern, this time a bearish one.

You can see a series of bullish candles advance, with the last candle’s body completely engulfed by the bearish long range candle.

This pattern again halted the uptrend, and started a downtrend that lasted 2 months, before another bullish engulfing candle pattern formed.

On this chart alone, there are three examples of how engulfing patterns can reverse a trend, but it is important to keep in mind that where the engulfing pattern forms, and the price action around it, is what’s important to increase the chances of success for the pattern. An engulfing formation in a range bound or directionless market does not provide useful information, simply because there is not trend to reverse.

**4.2 – Star Patterns**

The next candle patterns we will look at are morning and evening stars.

Morning and evening star patterns are also reversal patterns, and are made up of three candles.

Let’s break down each of these patterns to find out what they are trying to tell us about the market.

**4.21 Morning Star Pattern**

A morning star pattern is a type of bullish reversal pattern in which a downtrend is followed by a bullish sign. Because it warns of a potential reversal, they are often found at the bottom of downtrends.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/gfLgMtiUSvS8CfTHLIsM)

The first candle in the pattern is a bearish long-range candle that generally continues the seller’s momentum after a series of bearish candles.

The second candle starts out by opening noticeably lower than the previous candle’s close (commonly referred to as ‘gapping lower’). From here the sellers extend the downward advance for part of the period. However, at some point throughout the period, the buyers seize control from the sellers and push price to the highs of the period, and subsequently closes around the initial open. You will remember from section 1 that the candlestick described here is a Hammer or Dragonfly Doji.

The final candle in the morning star pattern is a bullish long-range candle similar in size the bearish long range candle that started the pattern.

**4.22 Evening Star Pattern**

An evening star is a bearish reversal pattern that is often found around the top of an uptrend. It warns of a potential reversal in the uptrend and may be the beginning of a bearish trend.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/f222A032TJ2mACORTyjz)

The first candle is a bullish long range candle that generally continues the buyer’s advance after a series of bullish candles.

The second candle starts out bullish, often gapping higher on the open with the buyers pushing the price higher for part of the period. At some point throughout the period, the sellers wrestle control from the buyers, and push price to the lows of the period, and close the candle around the same level as the open. You will remember from section 1 that the candlestick described here is a Shooting Star or Gravestone Doji.

The final candle in the evening star pattern is a bearish long-range candle similar in size to the bullish long range candle that started the pattern.

What makes the morning and evening star patterns important are the buyer and seller dynamics that they represent, and there are two main reasons for this.

Firstly, the failure of the middle candle to continue the advance in the trend direction, and the fact that it closes near the open of the period gives the first sign that the recent trend has shown weakness in its advance.

Secondly, the final candle in the formation completely reverses any gap formed by the middle candle, and generally wipes out any gain made by the first long range candle. This is a signal that the opposing forces in the recent trend, (the buyers for a morning star and the sellers for an evening star) have taken advantage of the weakness in the trend and assumed complete control of the price movement.

**4.23 Star Patterns in Action**

The example below shows a morning star pattern on the Australian ASX200 index on a weekly chart. As you can see, the trend at the start of the chart is bearish, with a series of red candles pushing price lower.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/xyic3ZZ5SMqq0BKxeA3B)

The first candle in the blue box continues this trend, with a bearish long range candle.

The middle candle shows that at one point in the week, it replicated nearly the entire length of the previous candle, so the selling pressure seemed set to continue. At some point throughout the week, the buyers assumed control and pushed price to near the highs of the week, closing above the open.

The final candle in the blue box is the bullish long range candle we are looking for to complete the pattern, and as you can see, its range was nearly twice as long as the first bearish long range candle that formed at the start of the pattern.

The example below shows an evening star pattern, again on the Australian ASX200 index but this time on a daily chart. The trend at the start of the chart is bullish, with a series of green candles pushing price higher.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/yyjJE65iQY2egw5Be6dw)

The first candle in the blue box continues this trend, with a bullish long range candle.

The middle candle shows that the buyers had full control as the candle extended higher, and the uptrend looked set to continue. At some point throughout the day, the sellers took control from the buyers and pushed price to near the lows of the day and closed below the open.

The final candle in the blue box is the bearish long range candle required to complete the pattern, and as you can see, its range is greater than the first long range candle that formed at the start the pattern.

In both of these examples, the price did not gap on the open of the middle candles in the pattern, but this is not a necessity for a morning or evening star to be valid. What is essential is the price action and trend direction prior to the formation.

It is important to note that the larger the timeframe that these patterns appear on, the greater the significance of the pattern.

You can see in the AUS200 Weekly example that because the morning star formed on a weekly chart, the pattern took three weeks to complete, and succeeded in reversing a very strong downtrend.

**4.3 – Harami Patterns**

Harami patterns generally form at the tops and bottoms of markets and are made up of two candles. Like the other reversal candle patterns discussed earlier, harami patterns indicate a level of directional control reversal by buyers in a down trending market and by sellers in an up-trending market.

There are two types of harami candle patterns, a bullish harami pattern and a bearish harami pattern.

**4.31 Bullish Harami Pattern**

A bullish harami pattern forms after a series of bearish candles in a downtrend.

The first part of the bullish harami pattern will be a bearish range candle, as can be seen in the example below.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/odRDQAAZTjqNlgYI0pBa)

The open of the next candle gaps up above the close of the bearish range candle, and fails to make a new low for the period. Although this is an inside candle, the conditions are more narrow. You may recall in Section 2 that ‘inside bars’ have a range that fits within the previous bar’s range. The distinction with Harami patterns is that the entire **range** of the second candle **must** fit within the **body** of the previous candle.

**4.32 Bearish Harami Pattern**

A bearish harami pattern forms after a series of bullish candles in an uptrend.

The first part of the bearish harami pattern will be a bullish range candle, as you can see in the example below.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/5L5F8DIBQA2SLxm4umAw)

The open of the next candle gaps down below the close of the bullish range candle, and fails to make a new high for the period. The entire trading range of the second candle is contained within the body of the bullish range candle.

The most important information you take from a bullish and bearish harami pattern is that a price gap occurs on the open of the second candle against the current trend, which in itself is a warning to be alert for a possible reversal. The fact that the second candle fails to make a new high in an uptrend or a new low in a downtrend confirms that a reversal of the most recent trend is likely.

**4.33 Harami Patterns in Action**

Let’s look at some examples of bullish and bearish harami patterns in action to demonstrate how useful they can be.

The example below shows a downtrend in action with a series of large bearish range candles in sequence on the AUDUSD 4-hour chart.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/KEd6LmKgStWbQvZR0h1g)

The second candle inside the blue box gapped a little higher than the close of the previous candle on its open, and traded within the range of the previous candle for the 4-hour period.

What followed was a reversal of an aggressive downtrend with a large bullish range candle that engulfed nearly two of the large bearish range candles prior to the harami pattern forming.

The example below shows a bearish harami pattern on the AUDUSD daily chart.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/dxWfejTziP1hmxSZsLrg)

The chart shows an uptrend in action, with two large bullish range candles in sequence.

You can see in the blue square that after the close of the last bullish range candle, the next candle gapped to open a little lower, and traded the entire day inside the range of the last bullish candle.

What follows is a large bearish long range candle that begins the reversal of the current uptrend.

Although the gaps on the open of the second candle in the harami patterns aren’t large, you have to be mindful that the examples are on a 4-hour and a daily chart. Because the AUDUSD operates in a 24-hour 5-day a week market, it is rare to see large opening gaps on larger timeframe charts during normal market hours.

Harami patterns found on the smaller timeframes often have larger gaps, due to the fact that they are more susceptible to sharper market movements that occur around the open and closes of key global market sessions.

**4.4 – Reversal Candlestick Patterns**

As I mentioned earlier, there are hundreds of different candlestick names and patterns around, with some being trend reversal patterns, and others continuation patterns.

The patterns we have focused on in this section best fit the style of trading that this course is built on, and complement the other trading tools throughout each module.

Although all of the patterns discussed represent the reversal group of candle patterns, you can still use them to trade in the direction of the trend.

In the example below, you can see that the prevailing long-term trend is clearly rising, but some of the reversal patterns we have focused on play a part in signalling the trend continuation.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/axlmPvBITCaU0q7rkEC5)

In the first example, the morning star pattern is reversing a countertrend inside the main prevailing trend.

Following this, the bullish engulfing pattern on the right is again signalling a countertrend reversal in the main prevailing trend.

As a trader, you don’t have to try and pick the absolute tops and bottoms of markets. If you focus on the bigger picture, and bring together the elements that complement what you are trying to achieve, you will see a big improvement in your consistency and your understanding of the market’s behaviour.
