## **Trend Lines**

We have spent a lot of time in other modules discussing the importance of identifying the direction of the trend, and trading in that direction. One of the best ways to not only identify the direction of the current trend, but also to enter trades in its direction is by using trend lines.

This section will focus on how to identify trend lines as they appear, and how to trade them in real time, to ensure you get the most out of this very important trading tool.

In this lesson, you will learn

-   How to identify a trend line in an uptrend
-   How to validate a trend line in an uptrend
-   How to identify a trend line in a downtrend
-   How to validate a trend line in a downtrend

A trend line can be described as a straight line that connects at least two troughs in an uptrend, or two peaks in a downtrend, and extends in front of price to act as the next potential support or resistance level.

Trend lines are amongst the most subjective tools you can use in technical analysis, so we will look at some of the rules to apply to ensure you are looking at the most effective forms of this very useful trading tool.

**2.1 - Uptrend Lines**

As the name suggests, an uptrend line is a straight line that slopes upward connecting two or more troughs, and projecting forward in front of price to give potential future support as you can see highlighted in the image below.

Trend lines are often considered dynamic support, and unlike a standard support or resistance line, the projection of the straight line is not horizontal, as the slope is governed by the aggressiveness of the current trend.

**2.2 - Uptrend Line Validation**

Part of a trading strategy when using trend lines is ensuring that they have been validated by the highs and lows that they are supporting.

The rules you can apply to validate an uptrend line are based around having a series of higher highs and higher lows, and as we discussed in previous modules, these are known as peaks and troughs.

You can see in the image above that the troughs are marked with a ‘T’, peaks with a ‘P’ and higher troughs with a ‘HT’ in sequence, which makes this a probable trend line.

To confirm that this trend line is valid, price must close higher than the peak that separates the first two troughs which touch the trend line as you can see highlighted above with the red dotted line. Once price has made a new high, a higher peak must form sometime in the future, which now validates the trend line.

There is a logical reason why this sequence of events needs to play out before you can rely on the trend line for support. A trend line is a tool used to help determine the direction of the trend, and to provide entry signals to join in the trend direction.

It is important to remember that a healthy uptrend will have smooth looking higher highs and higher lows as illustrated in the example above, and the healthier the uptrend is, the more likely it is that the uptrend line’s projection will continue to provide reliable support into the future. If price is failing to make new higher highs in between the troughs that the trend line is based on, then this signals a weakness in the uptrend, making the viability of the projected trend line’s support less reliable.

Let’s look at an uptrend line in a real market to see how it can be located and traded.

In the example above, there is an uptrend in progress, starting with a trough marked A. Price moves up through and makes a peak, and retraces down to the trend line and makes a higher trough marked B.

Once price breaks through the height of the peak that separates the first two troughs that start the trend line, you have validation, and can now place trades in the direction of the trend the next time price moves down and touches the trend line marked C and D.

Trend lines do not offer a projected take profit target when placing a trade primarily based on a touch, but they do have an assigned stop loss level. If the price penetrates the trend line (like at point D), the stop loss is placed just below the lowest low that crossed the trend line. If price didn’t penetrate the trend line, the stop loss can be placed just below the trend line itself as you can see in the example above at point C.

There is not rule in place for how long a trend line may last, or how many times it can act as support before price eventually breaks through, but generally, while the market continues to make higher highs and higher lows, the uptrend remains healthy.

The best way to help identify when the strength of a trend line may falter is to keep an eye on the peaks. As in the example above, when a peak fails to make new highs, the market could be signalling a potential weakness or reversal in the uptrend. At this point you should be mindful that the support the trend line has been providing may fail on future touches, and the trend may be reversing.

**2.3 - Downtrend Lines**

A downtrend line is best described as a straight line that slopes in a downward direction, connecting two or more peaks, and projecting forward in front of price to provide potential future resistance.

Again, these type of trend lines are considered dynamic resistance as unlike a standard resistance line, the projection of the straight line is not horizontal, as the slope is dictated by the aggressiveness of the current price downtrend.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/bXX2dhwLQSuckGTJAiCI)

In the example above, you can see a series of lower peaks and lower troughs, which is common in a healthy downtrend. You can see that the line that joins the peaks is sloping in a downward direction, and price is hitting resistance every time it pushes up and touches the trend line.

**2.4 - Downtrend Line Validation**

The rules applied to validating an uptrend line also apply to the validation of a downtrend line, only this time you are looking for a series of lower peaks and lower troughs.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/RPoawRnET2vPFYGW1B6w)

As you can see in the example above, you are looking for a peak, followed by a trough, and then a lower peak which forms the second touch of the downtrend line.

This now gives you a probable trend line, but again it will not be validated until price closes lower than the trough that separates the first two peaks that touch the trend line. Once price has made a new low, a lower trough must form sometime in the future, which now confirms the downtrend line.

The same logic applies as to why you need this sequence of events to play out before you can rely on the trend line to provide resistance. If price is failing to make new lower lows in between the peaks that the trend line is based on, then this signals a weakness in the downtrend, which makes the viability of the projected trend line’s resistance less reliable.

Let’s look at a downtrend line in a real market to see how it can be validated and traded.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/GtPN0YBTYgU6K1E5Rppg)

In the example above, there is a downtrend in progress, with the first peak marked A. Price moves down and makes a trough, only to pull back up to the trend line and make a lower peak marked B.

Once price breaks through the low of the trough that separates the first two peaks that start the trend line, you have validation. The next time price pulls up to touch the trend line marked above with a C, D and E, you can place trades short to join in the downtrend on the open of the next candle.

As with uptrend lines, downtrend lines do not offer a projected take profit target when placing a trade primarily based on a touch. However, they do have an assigned stop loss level, which is just above the highest high near the touch of the trend line, or if price didn’t penetrate the trend line, just above the trend line itself.

Identifying when a downtrend line could potentially falter follows the same process as an uptrend line, only this time you need to keep an eye on the troughs.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/K1bgsau9SIChKKfD1FD0)

When a trough fails to make new lows in between the peaks touching the trend line, the market could be signalling a potential weakness or reversal in the downtrend. As you can see in the example above, once a trough fails to make a new low and pulls back up to the trend line, the downtrend that has been in place could be starting to weaken.

A common question asked about trend lines is what constitutes a touch. Do you use the high or low of the candle, or does the candle or bar have to close on the trend line for it to be considered a touch?

There is no right or wrong answer to this question, as both touches can be considered grounds to validate the trend line.

One way to approach this is to consider any touch of the candle or bar on the trend line a valid touch, and if price goes through the trend line, and comes back to close on the trending side, then that makes the touch even more significant.

Its important to remember that the market is not a perfect mechanism, and prices aren’t always going to be exact. Being too pedantic about a level having to be perfect could cost you potential opportunities through missing out by only a handful of pips. It is always best to take the common-sense approach and not over think it.

Remember that trend lines only provide good support and resistance if they are obvious to other traders who will trade the same idea as you. If you have to think too hard about whether or not the trend line is there, then it may not be a quality one anyway, and it may be best to look for a better opportunity.
