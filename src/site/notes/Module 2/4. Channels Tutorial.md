## **Channels**

Locating and trading quality channels is the dream of many short and medium-term traders, as they are not only easy to trade once they are identified, but also quite reliable for extended periods of time.

This section focuses on learning how to identify and trade horizontal, ascending and descending channel patterns. We will explain how to trade them correctly when they form, and how to trade them when they eventually break.

In this lesson, you will learn

-   How to identify and trade horizontal channels
-   How to identify and trade ascending channels
-   How identify and trade descending channels
-   How to trade channel breakouts

**3.1 - Channels**

In technical analysis terms, a channel can be described as the price action between two parallel lines, with the top of the channel connecting peaks, and the bottom of the channel connecting troughs.

Channels are significant because they highlight an area where price is trapped between previous supply and demand zones.

There are three types of channels that form in the market, horizontal channels, ascending channels and descending channels, and depending on what timeframe a channel appears on, they could last for as little as a few hours, or as long as several years.

**3.11 Horizontal Channels**

You have probably already worked out that the support and resistance section we covered earlier has a close relationship with horizontal channels, and it makes sense that the bottom of the channel is a support line and top of the channel is a resistance line.

As illustrated in the example below, you begin by isolating an area where price is forming peaks and troughs at similar levels, and draw the support and resistance lines connecting them.

As with trend lines, a rule is applied to validate a channel before it is given any value into the future.

What you are looking for to validate a channel is two touches on each side, where price touches the bottom and the top of the channel twice, as you can see in the example below.

Once this happens, you can go on and trade any future touches by taking a short position if price reaches the top of the channel, and taking a long position if price touches the bottom of the channel.

You can place a stop loss just above the top of the channel for a sell position, and just below the bottom of the channel for a buy position.

The entry points are very clearly defined, and once you have entered the market, setting your take profit level is as easy as aiming for the top of the channel for a long position, and the bottom of the channel for a short position.

**3.2 - Ascending Channels**

As the name suggests, ascending channels have two parallel lines sloping in an upward direction, connecting a series of higher peaks and higher troughs, with the best ascending channels forming in strong uptrends.

The same rules apply in terms of validating ascending channels, where you will be looking for two touches on either side of the channel as illustrated in the example below.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/I66UuvNnRIWkxtrREeDQ)

Once the ascending channel is validated, you can take long positions when price comes down and touches the bottom of the channel, with the take profit targets for these long positions set at the top of the channel.

Stop losses for these trades are placed just below the bottom of the ascending channel to manage any downside risk of the price breaking out of the channel.

Although it is common for many trading strategies to suggest taking long positions at the bottom of the channel and short positions at the top of the channel, we choose to ignore short signals on ascending channels, and only take the long opportunities.

Ascending channels generally form and are at their most potent in uptrends, so taking short positions at the top of an ascending channel will involve entering counter-trend positions, which reduces the chances of success.

As I have explained in previous modules, trading in the direction of the trend is extremely important to professional traders, so taking short positions in an uptrend is something I will not do, regardless of the attractiveness of the channel.

**3.3 - Descending Channels**

The last of the channel family is descending channels, and they are made up of two parallel lines sloping in a downward direction connecting a series of lower peaks and lower troughs, and are at their most potent in strong downtrends.

The same rules apply in terms of validating descending channels, where two touches on each side of the channel are required for validation, as illustrated in the example below.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/EV1HgRs0QvekkUfD6Dp2)

Once the descending channel is validated, you can take short positions when price comes up and touches the top of the channel, with the take profit targets for these short positions set at the bottom of the channel.

Stop losses for these trades are placed just above the top of the descending channel.

Descending channels generally form and are at their most potent in downtrends, so taking long positions at the bottom of a descending channel will involve entering counter trend positions, which again means trading against the trend.

**3.4 - Channel Breakouts**

All good things must come to an end, and unfortunately trading channels is no different. The great news is that as good as trading inside channel patterns is, trading the end of a channel, referred to as the ‘break’, has its own systematic process.

Channel breakouts are significant because in the case of rising market, a supply zone has been broken demonstrating a depletion of selling pressure. In a falling market, a break of a key demand zone demonstrates a lack of buyer willingness to stop a price from falling further.

**3.41 Horizontal Channel Breakouts**

Let’s first look at a break of a horizontal channel. Because these channels are generally in directionless markets, a break to either side often signals the start of a new trend.

The example above demonstrates a break to the top of the channel. You need to be on the lookout for a candle or bar that closes outside the top of the channel in the timeframe that the channel looks the clearest.

Once you confirm that the candle or bar has closed above, you can take a long position on the open of the next candle.

To work out the take profit level, you measure the height of the channel from the bottom to the top, and extend this distance out from the top of the channel break as you can see in the example above, and place the stop loss level just below the bottom of the channel.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/LCRrrTdnRLW3gMUyLYjt)

The example above shows what a real top end channel break looks like. You can see that there is a break outside the top of the channel marked in the blue box.

The height of the channel is measured and projected out to give you the take profit target, and the stop loss is placed just below the bottom of the channel as illustrated in the example above.

The process of trading a breakout of the bottom of the channel works in a similar way, only you are taking a short position.

Once you confirm that the candle or bar has closed below the bottom of the channel, you can take a short position on the open of the next candle.

To work out the take profit level, you measure the height of the channel from the bottom to the top, and extend this distance out from the bottom of the channel break, with the stop loss level placed just above the top of the channel.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/CedaP1dTaKzUGlk4lMMm)

The example above shows what a real bottom end channel break looks like. You can see that there is a break outside the bottom of the channel marked in the blue box.

The height of the channel is measured and projected out to give you the take profit target, and the stop loss is placed just above the top of the channel as illustrated in the example above.

**3.42 Ascending Channel Breakouts**

The best ascending channels form in an uptrend, so when they come to an end, the best breaks happen at the bottom of the channel, which generally signals a reversal of the uptrend.

For this reason, you should only trade the bottom breaks of an ascending channel, because if you were trading the break of the top of an ascending channel, the trend would have to increase aggressively from what is already a healthy uptrend. Although this is possible and does sometimes happen, it is less likely to occur, so it doesn’t make that method of trading consistently successful.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/D6PKwqGXRGipExw8jJXe)

The example above shows a series of higher peaks and higher troughs, with the top and bottom of the channel marked with parallel lines. Towards the end, there is move that closes below the bottom of the channel.

Once you confirm that the candle or bar has closed below the bottom channel line, you can take a short position on the open of the next candle.

To work out the take profit level of an ascending channel, you measure the height of the channel from the bottom to the top near where the break occurred, and extend this distance out from the bottom of the channel break.

The stop loss level is then placed just above the top of the channel as demonstrated above.

The example above shows what a real ascending channel break looks like. You can see that there is a break outside the bottom of the channel marked in the blue box.

The height of the channel is then measured and projected out to give you the take profit target, and the stop loss is placed just above the top of the channel as you can see in the example.

**3.43 Descending Channel Breakouts**

For the same reasons discussed earlier regarding ascending channels, you should only trade the break of the tops of descending channels.

The example below shows a series of lower peaks and lower troughs, with the top and bottom of the channel marked with parallel lines. Towards the end, there is a move that closes up above the top of the channel.

Once you confirm that the candle or bar has closed above the top of the channel, you can take a long position on the open of the next candle.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/6mzk693QRXu9h2tZXMPY)

To work out the take profit level on a descending channel, you measure the height of the channel from the bottom to the top near where the break occurred, and extend this distance out from the top of the channel break, placing a stop loss just below the bottom of the channel.

The example above shows what a real descending channel break looks like. You can see that there is a break outside the top of the channel marked in the blue box.

The height of the channel is then measured and projected out above the break to give you the take profit target, with the stop loss placed just below the bottom of the channel as you can see in the example above.

Quality channels are worth their weight in gold when they are identified and could be a great addition to your trading strategies in the future.
