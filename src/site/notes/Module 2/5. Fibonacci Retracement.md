# Fibonacci Retracements Tutorial


## **Fibonacci Retracements**

I am certain many of you have heard the term Fibonacci at some stage, where in trading terms, Fibonacci fans, grids, retracements and extensions are all very popular.

This section will focus on Fibonacci retracements, as although many of the other Fibonacci tools have been proven useful, we have found Fibonacci Retracements the most reliable tool that work best with our trading ideology.

In this lesson, you will learn

-   What the Fibonacci numbers are and why they are important
-   How to interpret and use Fibonacci Retracements in an uptrend
-   How to interpret the most optimal Fibonacci Retracement zones
-   How to interpret and use Fibonacci Retracements in a downtrend

**4.1 – Fibonacci Numbers**

Fibonacci numbers were first discovered in the 12th century by an Italian mathematician named Leonardo Fibonacci.

Fibonacci numbers can be best described as a sequence of numbers where each successive number is the sum of the two previous numbers. As you can see in the example below, each number is added to the previous number, and this process continues to extrapolate out theoretically to infinity.

The relevance of these numbers have a few important interrelationships, but amongst the most important of these, is that any number is approximately 1.618 times its preceding number.

1.618 bares important significance, as it is known as the golden ratio or Phi.

Since its discovery, the golden ratio has been linked with great significance to many ancient structures and architecture such as the pyramids and the Parthenon, and still today is used extensively in many engineering structures and modern-day scientific research discoveries.

**4.2 - Fibonacci Retracements in an Uptrend**

In technical analysis terms, Fibonacci retracements are viewed as areas of support and resistance, and price often consolidates at these levels before continuing in the original direction of the trend. Fibonacci levels are widely used by traders to help identify zones to enter or exit positions, as well as areas to place stop loss and take profit targets.

Fibonacci retracements in an uptrend are used to identify levels of support and are drawn from the left to the right. When measuring the length of a move in an uptrend, you start the Fibonacci Retracement tool at the bottom of the upswing's lowest trough and measure to the top of the upswing's highest peak to project the Fibonacci retracement lines.

The measurement is always taken from the lowest low of the candle or bar to the highest high of the upswing as you can see in the example above.

When the length is measured from the low to the high with the Fibonacci Retracement tool, five horizontal lines project forward to the edge of the screen. These support levels are calculated by dividing the vertical distance by the Fibonacci ratios of 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8% and 100%.

Fibonacci retracement lines are static lines that do not change once the levels have been drawn, so they are easy to monitor once they have been identified correctly.

Fibonacci levels measure the percent move of the length that you are measuring, and as you can see in the example above, the 50% Fibonacci level is half the distance of the entire move. Each of these lines represents an area of support when price pulls back during an uptrend, and with so many traders using these levels, the support is often significant.

**4.21 Fibonacci Retracements Trading Rules in an Uptrend**

We apply two rules when using Fibonacci retracement levels as part of our trading strategy.

**Rule 1** - We **_only ever use the 38.2% and the 50% levels as a support zone._**

**Rule 2** - **_The retracement level we are considering using as support must have at least one other form of support or resistance backing it up._**

Like so many things in trading, Fibonacci retracements in isolation don’t often work as successfully as you would hope, and much of this has to do with the subjectivity of where they are drawn.

In theory, you could draw a Fibonacci retracement between any swing low and swing high, but if you are the only one seeing the retracement level you are expecting to be support, then the likelihood of it providing that support may not be so reliable.

Remember that support at many Fibonacci zones becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy due to the number of people trading them, so it is important that only the quality retracements are used to ensure that as many traders as possible are trading the same thing.

**4.3 – Optimal Fibonacci Retracement Zones**

The inverse of the golden ratio is 0.618, and is considered by many traders the most significant level of the Fibonacci numbers, due to the historical significance and geometrical importance.

As important as this level may seem, we don’t consider it the most important level. In fact, if price is in an uptrend and pulls back all the way to the 0.618 level, in our eyes, the uptrend has taken a significant step backward, and any future movement up may be debilitated by the many support zones it had to break to reach this level.

It is important to remember that quite often, support zones become role reversal areas, and may act as resistance for price to move back through them.

The example above on the left displays how you can measure the swing low to the swing high with the Fibonacci Retracement tool, which will bring up the key levels. The first place you would expect to find support will be the 23.6% level.

Although this level is a Fibonacci level, in our experience, it must be a very strong trend with shallow pullbacks for this level to hold, so we generally discard it.

The next area you would expect support would be the 38.2% level. Price moves down and touches this level, and then reverses and continues with the uptrend. Although it may find a little bit of resistance at the 23.6% level, you would still expect the move of the trend to break through.

On the right, there is another example of a move up. Again the move up is measured and the Fibonacci lines are projected out.

As you can see in this example, price again breaks through the support level at 23.6%, and goes on to break the 38.2% and the 50%, the zones we consider the most important. Once price gets to the 61.8% level, it reverses and tries to go higher.

The problem now is that there are three new resistance zones that price has to break through in order to move higher, with two of them, the 38.2% and the 50% levels considered significant.

The trend has already lost a significant amount of momentum to reach this zone, and now has to contend with the extra resistance that may not have been there on the initial move up.

This is the reason we only use the Fibonacci retracement levels of 38.2% and 50% in our trading, as these levels complement the movement of a healthy trend.

When trading in any direction, it is always important to identify any obstacles that may be in your desired path, prior to entering a trade. Resistance such as role reversal zones can prove to be difficult areas for price to break through, and can often put take profit levels which may have otherwise been correct under increased pressure.

Now let’s look at a chart to put these rules into practice.

The example above shows that the market is making a series of higher highs and higher lows, and you can pick the swing low and high level to set up the Fibonacci retracement levels.

The Fibonacci zones are then projected out to give horizontal support lines, and you can see that price came back down to the 50% level.

This meets the first of the rules, as this is one of the key Fibonacci levels, and should provide strong support.

You can now look back to search for other evidence as to why this level may have greater support.

Over on the left you can see that this same area was resistance not that long ago, with the market rejecting off it. This area could now have a role reversal, and provide extra weight for this level of support.

This confirms rule number 2, which gives you the all clear to treat this level as a solid support zone.

**4.4 - Fibonacci Retracements in a Downtrend**

Fibonacci retracements are also used in downtrends, only this time they are used as resistance.

Again, Fibonacci levels are drawn from the left to the right, and when measuring the length of a move in a downtrend, you start the Fibonacci Retracement tool at the top of the downswing's highest peak and measure to the bottom of the downswing's lowest trough to project the Fibonacci lines.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/tkVsjgjQ8SgRe5OD0B8c)

As you can see in the example above, when the length is measured from the high to the low with the Fibonacci Retracement tool, five horizontal lines project forward to the edge of the screen. These resistance levels are calculated the same way as previously discussed, by dividing the vertical distance by the Fibonacci ratios of 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8% and 100%.

**4.41 Fibonacci Retracements Trading Rules in a Downtrend**

The same two rules apply when using Fibonacci retracement levels as part of a trading strategy in a downtrend, only this time the retracement zones are used as resistance, not support.

**Rule 1** - **_We only ever use the 38.2% and the 50% levels as a resistance zone._**

**Rule 2** - **_The retracement level we are considering using as resistance must have at least one other form of support or resistance backing it up._**

Let’s look at a real chart and put these rules into practice for a downtrend.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/5nmthS9pQvmAMQ51MEPg)

The example above shows that the market is making a series of lower highs and lower lows, and you can pick the swing high and low level to measure the Fibonacci Retracement tool.

The Fibonacci zones are then projected out to give horizontal resistance lines, and you can see that price pulled back up to the 38.2% level.

This meets the first of the rules, as this is one of the key Fibonacci levels, and should provide strong resistance.

You can now look back to search for other evidence as to why this level may have greater resistance.

Over on the left, you can see that this same area was support not that long ago, with the market rejecting off it. This area could now have a role reversal to add more weight to the resistance zone.

This confirms rule number 2, which could now provide a solid resistance zone.

Using Fibonacci retracement levels as part of your trading strategy can be very beneficial, and is widely used by the trading fraternity. Like most things in trading, the more that traders can visualise what they are seeing unfold on the charts, the greater the chance of success.

Good Fibonacci retracement levels work very well in strong trends, so they give you the ability to join an established trend at optimal zones.

The best advice we can give you regarding Fibonacci retracements is to use them in conjunction with other trading techniques and systems you will learn throughout this course.

When the key levels are combined with other technical analysis patterns and indicators, the reliability of the key Fibonacci retracement zones increase significantly, as will the success rate of their signals.
