## Support & Resistance

In isolation, most trading tools and methods rarely perform as expected without the external confirmation of other elements or indicators.

Support and resistance are one of those tools that work independently of other indicators very successfully. In fact, such is the power of support and resistance, many trading strategies are built around them with very minimal external confirmations used to verify trading opportunities.

In this lesson, you will learn

-   How to identify and trade horizontal support
-   How to identify and trade horizontal resistance
-   How support and resistance can work together
-   How to identify and trade role reversal zones

Horizontal support forms because of a build-up of demand (buyers) at a certain price level. Conversely, horizontal resistance forms because of a build-up of supply (sellers).

**1.1 – Horizontal Support**

In trading terms, an area of support is a zone where price comes down and touches the same area a number of times and fails to go lower. Price then moves in an upward direction before coming down and trying to break lower at the same level.

Two touches of the same area gives confirmation that the level is strong, and may provide further support into the future.

The image above shows a horizontal green line that is labelled support, and you can see how price has come down a number of times and bounced off it. When we talk about support and resistance in trading terms, they are considered static, meaning that the levels don’t change, and are always horizontal. Dynamic support and resistance does exist, but we will talk about that in a later section.

Support and resistance can be found in all timeframes, but it is the ability to use support and resistance in the right timeframe relative to your trade plan that is key to using it most effectively.

As an example, if you have a support line that is visible on a weekly chart with multiple touches over a long period of time, this support will be very relevant in all of the timeframes below it.

A support line that is only visible on a 15-minute chart, although important for that particular timeframe and the ones below it, would not be so significant on a 4-hour or daily chart.

Support and resistance levels are also enhanced when they coincide with a key price point such as round numbers which often have psychological significance, which adds further strength to a level.

For instance, if you have a support line drawn similar to the image above, and the horizontal line happens to be at a key price point, such as a round number like the 1.2000 level on the EURUSD currency pair, you can expect that support level to be even more significant.

The chart above is an example of how support looks in a real market, and how price interacts with the horizontal support line.

Once you have the initial two touches, it is reasonable to expect that this is a valid support line, as price has attempted to go higher, failed and retreated to the same zone.

You can now be confident in the future that if price retraces here again, it should be met with a considerable amount of support to stop it from going lower, as it does in the example above.

This zone provided significant support, and you can see that the price tested this level several times before finally pushing up to make new highs.

**1.2 – Horizontal Resistance**

As the name suggests, resistance is the opposite of support, and can be found above price. The example below shows a horizontal red line labelled resistance, and you can see how price has pushed up a number of times, failing to make a new high and bouncing down off the level.

This type of resistance zone is considered static resistance, as it does not change or move when price does.

Once price pushes up and touches the same zone a number of times and fails to break through, it provides some confirmation that the level is strong, and may provide further resistance into the future.

The chart above is an example of how resistance looks in a real market, and how price interacts with the horizontal resistance line.

Once you see the initial two touches, it is reasonable to expect that this is a valid resistance line, as price has attempted to go lower, failed and retraced to the same zone.

You can now be confident into the future that if price retraces here again, it should be met with a considerable amount of resistance to stop it from going higher, as it does in the example above.

This zone provided significant resistance, and you can see that price tested this level several times before finally pushing down to make new lows.

**1.3 - Support and Resistance Working Together**

When support and resistance lines are seen close together as they are in the example below, they often work as short-term targets for price, so when the price bounces off the top end resistance, it advances quite quickly to the previous support zone. This is also referred to as a channel, but we will talk about that in more depth later in the module.

This happens often in many timeframes so keep in mind that when you are placing your trades based on support and resistance, if you place a buy trade at the support zone, a good price point to consider taking profits is a previous resistance zone. The opposite is true for short positions, where a good price point to take profit is a previous support zone.

**1.4 - Role Reversal**

**1.41 Uptrend Role Reversal**

In trading terms, a role reversal occurs in an uptrend when an area of resistance is broken, and the price returns to the same level after moving higher, and finds support at the very area that was resistance before the break.

Role reversal is not a new concept, but not many traders utilize the power of a role reversal to its full potential, especially in longer-term trends.

Role reversal zones are important because they signify a previous level of supply and demand congestion. In an up-trending market, previous supply zones tend to become new demand zones, and previous demand zones can become new supply zones. It is the previous supply and demand congestion that makes these levels significant, thereby often reversing their roles.

The dynamics of role reversals are straightforward, and in the example above, you can see that price had trouble breaking through the resistance zone marked in red, and when it eventually did and went on to make a new high, it retraced all the way back to the same level marked in green. What was the resistance is now the new support.

In normal trading, you would generally have to wait for at least two touches of a zone before you could expect it to be a support level and draw a horizontal line, but when price pulls back to an area of recent resistance, this is not the case, and any retrace to this zone would be expected to provide support on the first touch.

In many ways, this area is even stronger than a standard level of support in an uptrend because of how price reacted to this area prior to breaking through. The very fact that the zone provided significant resistance recently, adds to the strength of the support the zone may now provide.

**1.42 Downtrend Role Reversal**

Role reversal also works the opposite way in a downtrend, where an area that was originally support becomes resistance once it breaks through, as it is highlighted in the example below.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/yb4eDm6cROusZiTQUasv)

When price breaks through the initial support, it makes a new low, and pulls up to the same area it had trouble breaking though earlier.

Again, in normal trading conditions you would have to wait for at least two touches of a zone before you could expect it to be a resistance level and draw a horizontal line, but when price pulls back to an area that provided recent support, the level would be expected to provide resistance on the first touch.

An added benefit to trading a role reversal area is that you will always be trading in the direction of the trend. This is because there would have to be a series of higher highs or lower lows for a role reversal area to appear, making role reversals a great entry point when combined with other technical signals.

**1.43 Role Reversal in Action**

The image below is an example of what a role reversal looks like on an actual chart, and how you go about interpreting it. You can see that price is in a sideways motion, hitting the top of the resistance zone marked in red on four occasions, where each of the touches only lasted two periods before the market was rejected sharply to the previous lows.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/m0NbQz8dSrK95xdKfCWi)

When price finally broke through the level, it extended up aggressively before pulling back to the same area marked in green, which remained a support base for a considerable amount of time.

The example below shows a role reversal in action, this time in a downtrend. You can see that price is clearly trending down, finding support in the areas highlighted in green, before breaking through, forming a new low and pushing up to retest the level marked in red.

The importance of support and resistance zones, and the role reversal of these zones cannot be understated, and many successful trading strategies can be built around this concept alone, when these areas are traded correctly.
