In the third part of the price and trend analysis series, we will look at multi-timeframe chart analysis, and how it can give a broader view of the market conditions. We will look at some of the ways that we can analyse larger timeframe candles by breaking them down into smaller timeframes, to help give a real insight about the dynamics of the buyers and the sellers within each period.

In this lesson, you will learn

-   How to interpret large timeframe candles on smaller charts
-   How to understand the buyer and seller dynamics across different timeframes
-   The importance of candle close confirmations
-   How to interpret multi-timeframe chart analysis

**3.1 - Candle Analysis**

Multi-timeframe analysis is an integral part of any trading strategy, and it is important to understand the dynamics of each of the timeframes you are looking at before making any trading decisions.

**3.11 Daily Candle Analysis**

It’s important to recognise that any particular timeframe that you’re looking at is made up of smaller times e.g. an hourly candle is made of twelve 5-minute candles or sixty 1-minute candles. So, whilst you might look at an hourly candle that looks to support a particular pattern or price trend, it’s important to understand what happened within that candle’s time period of an hour to get a better understanding of the price activity.

Now, when analysing timeframes, it’s also important to note that while the market is open, the most recent candle you see on a live chart will be incomplete. It only shows the price action from the beginning of that timeframe to the current point in time and will only be complete once that full timeframe has elapsed. For example, while the market’s open, the most recent daily candle you see at 11:00 am is incomplete and could look vastly different to the complete daily candle on market close.

The image below displays a daily candle. As you can see, it is a bullish candle, meaning that the open is lower than the close. You can see the high that the daily candle reached, as well as the low, but what is not apparent is the price action that caused this daily candle to form the way it did.

Looking at this candle in isolation does not give the information that you need in terms of how price moved throughout the day, and indeed if it finished strongly, or if it came off its high towards the end of the period.

If you take it back one timeframe to a 4-hour chart, you will start to see a picture of how the day's trading unfolded.

The one thing you do know for certain is the open of the day. Going from left to right, the first 4-hour candle was a bullish one, as was the second. Depending on where your broker servers are based, the start of the day may have coincided with the Asian trading session open, so you know the entire session was bullish.

However, the beginning of the London and European opens saw a shift in the buyer and seller dynamic, which forced price down to the lows of the day. A trader who entered the market looking at the current day’s movement would likely have thought the bullish behaviour was set to continue, and any long trade would have seen a significant retrace in the next few hours of trading.

During the fourth 4-hour candle, the buyers took over the trend direction quite aggressively, and reversed the negative sentiment to close the London trading session at a new daily high.

The first part of the New York session continued the bullish advance, moving close to the high of the day, before retreating in the second part of the trading session as you can see with the last bearish short-range candle.

The information from the smaller timeframe provides insight as to which of the trading sessions were the strongest, and how the end of the day played out.

The importance of the daily timeframe cannot be underestimated, as it gives a holistic view of the entire world’s sentiment towards that particular trading instrument.

**3.12 Four Hour Candle Analysis**

Let’s now break down a 4-hour candle, and reconstruct the price action that happened one timeframe lower on the hourly chart in the example below.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/XKPLo7qxRBORfcwCQU2Y)

Again, the thing you know for certain is the open of the 4-hour candle. The first 1-hour candle was a bullish one, followed by a bearish long-range candle. The third candle in the 1-hour timeframe completely reversed the temporary negative sentiment, and extended to reach a new high for the 4-hour period.

The last 1-hour candle was still bullish but you can see that once the high of the period was reached, price retraced almost a third of the candle’s total range, which indicates some weakness.

If you looked at the 4-hour candle in isolation, this weakness is not so obvious, and you could be led to believe that the long range bullish candle finished with the same momentum as it started with.

This information may not seem significant to longer-term traders who enter and stay in trades for days or weeks at a time, but for swing traders, and scalping traders who trade intra-day or on small timeframes, this information is invaluable to determine the current strengths or weaknesses in the current price momentum.

**3.2 – Buyer and Seller Dynamics**

Let's take a look and see what happens when we drop back two timeframes to a 15-minute chart, to understand the different buyer and seller dynamics.

As you can see in the example below, the 4-hour candle is showing a very clear shooting star, so you know immediately that price has closed close to or on the low.

What isn’t apparent is how a trader would have fared had they been trading short-term price action throughout that period.

As the 15-minute candles are starting to form, the first two hours of this candle provided some good long opportunities, with a series of long range bullish candles forming in sequence.

A trader looking at the 4-hour candle in isolation would not have seen this price movement, and may not have had a clear understanding of how the price dynamics changed throughout the period.

On the 15-minute chart, we can see very clearly that the last six 15-minute candles are mainly bearish, with the final candle retreating nearly half of the 4 hours' total range.

This information is invaluable to traders, as the price action in the first half of the shooting star was clearly in an uptrend, and if this shooting star formed at the top of an uptrend or at a resistance zone, it added more evidence that the newly established bearish momentum is likely to continue.

**3.3 - Candle Close Confirmation**

Given the price movements you have just seen on the smaller timeframes, it should be obvious to you why waiting for the confirmation of a close of a candle is vital before making any trading decisions.

The daily candle example below highlights the importance of close confirmation.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/vgE6HGcJSPe40SfGeNOJ)

As you can see at the close of the Asian market, this daily candle appears to be a bullish long-range candle, usually indicating a healthy-looking uptrend.

Any traders who look at this daily candle without a confirmed close may act on the information they are seeing, and trade long with the anticipation that this candle will reflect the entire period. If the candle did close as it looks here, this would be a reasonable expectation.

The London and European markets have pushed the candle down to around the mid-point of the Asian market’s range by the time they closed. Although this candle is still reflecting a bullish candle, it is not as convincing as what it was at the end of the Asian market close.

Again, any trader entering on the current available information is still taking a chance that the candle will look very different when it closes.

The last candle in the example shows what the candle looked like when it did finally close at the end of the US trading day. The same candle that looked like a bullish long-range candle is now a very bearish shooting star.

Traders who jumped the gun and traded the bullish long-range candle early will already be incurring loses, but more importantly, shooting star candles generally signal a reversal in trend, so the chances of these trades turning profitable is reduced significantly.

In fact, traders who waited for the confirmation close would be looking at entering short positions in the near-term.

**3.4 – Multi-Timeframe Chart Analysis**

As with multi-timeframe analysis on candles, analysing charts in the same manner can give you valuable insight into where price may be heading.

Looking at this six-week example on the weekly chart below, you can see a series of indecision candles following a solid downtrend. Although important, this information does not provide any insight as to when it might be a good time to enter a long position, or indeed if a long position is valid, so to try and determine the best course of action, we take a look at a different chart timeframe.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/aKi6x0z9SSSyIfGyOE8N)

When you look at the daily chart below for the same period highlighted inside the blue box, you can see that there were two larger indecision candles, one of which meets the criteria for a hammer, after a series of bearish candles, which suggests potential bullish price momentum.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/pAXjBWKzQy2LVgn1aHS4)

Let’s take the same six-week period and see what it looks like on the 4-hour chart below. Again, the price for the six-week period is contained inside the blue box, and now you can see what’s called a double bottom, where the ‘bottoms’ are in the same place as the two long indecision candles on the daily chart. (Double Bottoms are recognised by a twice-touched low forming a “W” shape which signals a potential reversal of a downtrend and beginning of a potential uptrend. We will cover them in more detail in Module 3 Section 1.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/NBriKSYqSLOlbIvZ1q9O)

To get further insight for future price activity, let’s look at the same six-week period on a 1-hour chart depicted in the blue box below. The same double bottom is even clearer to see now, but more importantly, you can see a sequence of a trough, a peak, a higher trough and a higher peak, which gives you the signal that the longer-term trend on the 1-hour chart has moved from a downtrend to an uptrend.

This multi-timeframe chart analysis, although relatively basic has provided an entry point to trade the indecision candles on the weekly chart with some clarity as to what the price action may be doing next. This will give you the tools and understanding to dig deeper into your technical analysis when the price activity isn’t obviously indicating a price trend.
