## **Price Trends**

I am sure many of you have heard the adage, trend is your friend, but it is so much more than just a saying. When you trade with the prevailing trend in your favour, your entry points don’t have to be as precise, and your take profit targets don’t have to be as sharp as they need to be when trading against the trend.

This section focuses on the importance of understanding short-term and long-term price trends inside the price chart, and how to determine when these trends have changed.

In this lesson, you will learn

-   How to identify short-term trends that form inside price
-   The trading conditions that do not cause a change of trend
-   How to identify long-term trends that form inside price
-   How to identify a change of a long-term trend

**2.1 Short-term Trends**

Short-term trends are trends that form inside the price chart that use the most recent price action to determine their direction. A definition of a short-term uptrend is a sequence of bars that have higher highs and higher lows than the previous bar, as you can see in the image below.

Similarly, a definition of a short-term downtrend is a sequence of bars that have lower highs and lower lows than the previous bar.

To remove any uncertainty as to whether you are seeing a short-term uptrend or a short-term downtrend in action, you can apply the following rules.

**_'Only a bar with a lower high and lower low reverses a short-term uptrend'_**

**_'Only a bar with a higher low and higher high reverses a short-term downtrend'_**

These two simple rules will ensure that you know which direction the short-term trend is headed quickly and with a degree of certainty.

**2.2 - Special Change of Trend Conditions**

Whilst it is important to acknowledge price conditions that do indicate change in trend, it is also important to recognise price conditions that whilst they might look important, don’t actually indicate a change in price trend. The next type of patterns we’ll look at will help you determine what price activity is actually just noise and not a leading indicator of changes in price trend.

**2.21 Inside Bars**

One type of condition that does **_not_** meet the condition of a change in price trend is an inside bar. Inside bars don’t meet a change of trend condition because the entire price action of the current bar or candle is contained within the range of the previous bar or candle, indicating a pausing of momentum.

There are three types of conditions that meet the criteria of an inside bar.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/pGIQqca5TZ2Jlr3PdDqg)

1. The entire range of the period fits inside the previous period.

2. The high price of the period is equal to the top of the previous period and the low price is higher than the bottom of the previous low.

3. The low of the period is equal to the low of the previous period and the high is lower than the top of the previous period.

**2.22 Outside Bars**

Whilst inside bars don’t indicate a change in price trend, neither do outside bars. Outside bars don’t meet a change of trend condition because the entire price action of the current bar or candle is contained within the range of the previous bar or candle, indicating a pausing of momentum.

There are three types of conditions that meet the criteria of an outside bar.

1. Both the high and the low of the range are greater than the previous period.

2. The high of the range is equal to the high of the previous period and the low is lower than the bottom of the previous period.

3. The low of the period is equal to the low of the previous period and the high is higher than the top of the previous period.

These six conditions, along with a higher highs and a higher lows and a lower highs and a lower lows cover every possible bar condition, which makes determining the short-term trend an easy to follow process.

We’ve now covered all six bar conditions that do not indicate a change in price trend and will help you determine price activity that is not significant – now we focus on activities that will help give indications as to the direction of the short-term trend.

The final step for determining the direction of the short-term trend involves labelling each change of trend that occurs on the short-term price trend with a P (representing a peak) and a T (representing a trough).

To label peaks and troughs, what we do is look back over the historical price activity, identify short term trends in price and label them accordingly. Short-term uptrends that are reversed are labelled with a P, and short-term downtrends that are reversed are labelled with a T.

This structure will display a series of peaks and troughs similar to what you see here in the example below.

**2.23 Short-term Peaks and Troughs in Action**

The example below demonstrates how labelling the peaks and troughs would appear on a real chart.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/fCuX2jVISkioBBLVFTZF)

As the example shows, once labelled, the peaks and troughs become very clear, and it is easy to determine the direction of the trend.

**2.3 - Long-term Trends**

Whilst it is important to assess short term trends in price activity, it is also important to determine long term trends. Once the analysis is carried out on the short-term trend, the analysis can be taken a step further to identify the long-term trend inside of the price chart.

The same analytical process used earlier to determine the direction of the short-term price trend is now applied to determine the direction of the long-term price trend.

What we are looking to identify is if the peak and trough are both higher than the peak and trough of the previous period, or conversely if the peak and trough are both lower than the previous periods' peak and trough.

Whilst this may seem confusing, a simple way to remember is by understanding the following steps;

If there is a sequence of a peak, a higher trough and then a higher peak, this will define a long-term uptrend.

If there is a sequence of a trough, a lower peak and then a lower trough, this will define a long-term downtrend.

This style of analysis makes it easier to identify the direction of the long-term trend in tricky markets where the price action is not so obvious.

Assessing both long-term and short-term trends will give a better indication of expected price trends as opposed to assessing them in isolation.

Although this type of analysis may seem a little confusing at first, once you put it into practice, the logic of how it works will quickly make sense to you.

As you can see in the example above, the price trends are a lot easier to see when they are broken down in this manner, and you can quickly determine the direction that trades should be placed in.

**2.31 Long-term Trends in Action**

In theory, trends can be easy to identify, especially when there are lines drawn and evenly spaced as illustrated in the previous examples. The example below applies the theory to a real chart to show how it will look in a trading environment.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/zjD0ReK6SfeZTrBFHfFl)

Just by looking at this chart, you can see that there is an uptrend, but trends aren’t always this easy to spot, so let’s put into action the peaks and troughs method to explain how it can help determine trends.

Firstly you have a trough at the start of the chart marked with a T.

You can then see the price reversal near the top of the peak which is marked with a P.

As you go through the stages of the short-term analysis, the peaks and troughs begin to form, painting a clearer picture of what the trend is doing. You can label higher peaks as HP and higher troughs as HT as this makes it easier to visualise.

Once all of the peaks and troughs have been labelled, it is easy to draw connector lines that link the troughs and peaks together, and as you can see in the image above, even though you are looking at a real chart, identifying this trend is as easy as it was in the theoretical example earlier.

Remember that the market is not always this clear in direction, so it is good practice to label the peaks and troughs for the more challenging markets conditions. In between all of the labelled peaks and troughs above, you can see that the only time the trend reversed was when there was a candle with a higher high and a higher low or a lower high and a lower low.

Now let’s look at how you would apply the same set up in a long-term downtrend. Again, once all of the peaks and troughs are marked out, it becomes easier to see which of the peaks and troughs are higher or lower than each other.

The image below shows a real example of how the theory works in a long-term downtrend.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/eCox3O5TQ8eQxK87nSzQ)

You can now go through and label peaks that are lower than the previous peak with an LP, representing a lower peak, and you can mark troughs that are lower than the previous troughs with a LT, representing a lower trough.

Once this is completed, it is easy to draw connector lines that link the troughs and peaks together, and as you can see, even though you are looking at a real chart, identifying this downtrend is as easy as it was in the theoretical example earlier.

You need to keep in mind that although this downtrend looks obvious, the market isn’t always as clear, so it is good practice to apply this method to remove any uncertainty as to which way the trend is headed.

**2.4 - Long-term Trend Changes**

Once the direction of a long-term trend has been identified, it is just as important to understand when that trend has changed direction.

The example below on the left displays a series of higher peaks and higher troughs.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/HMvAuQiQK2pj0MrRfTO6)

A change of trend occurs when price makes a lower peak, and then continues down to make a lower trough.

Once this sequence happens, the longer-term uptrend has ended, and the sequence that starts a long-term downtrend begins.

The example above on the right displays a series of lower peaks and lower troughs, indicating a long-term downtrend.

A change of trend occurs when price makes a higher trough, and then continues up to make a higher peak.

Once this sequence happens, the longer-term price downtrend has ended, and the sequence that starts a long-term uptrend begins.

**2.41 Change of a Long-term Trend in Action**

Now let’s look at a real example of how the long-term uptrend can change.

In the image below, you can see that there are a series of higher peaks and higher troughs that are confirming a long-term uptrend.

Closer to the end of the chart, there is a situation where price has formed a lower peak. This is the first signal that there may be potential change of trend.

Once price crosses below the previous higher trough, there is confirmation that the current long-term uptrend has come to an end, and the new sequence of a trough, a lower peak and now a lower trough confirms that a new long-term downtrend has commenced.

The example below shows a series of lower peaks and lower troughs that are confirming the market is in a long-term downtrend.

Closer to the end of the chart, there is a situation where price has formed a higher trough. This is the first signal that there may be a potential change of trend.

Once price crossed above the previous lower peak, there is confirmation that the current long-term downtrend has come to an end, and the new sequence of a peak, a higher trough and now a higher peak confirms that a new long-term uptrend has commenced.

You have now been able to establish the short and long-term trends inside the price chart without using a single external indicator except for the most important one, the leading indicator known as price action.

This method works in any timeframe exactly the same way but remember that the larger the timeframe, the more significant the trend.
