# **Candles & Bars Tutorial**

The first section of this module focuses on candles and bars, and the important information they provide traders about the current price action.

In this lesson, you will learn

-   The types of charts that are available on most platforms
-   The components that make up candles and bars
-   How to identify the most popular candlestick patterns
-   How to interpret closes on a bar

**1.1 - Types of Charts**

The first part of this lesson will focus on the types of charts you will encounter on most trading platforms, and how each of the different charts function.

**1.11 Line Charts**

The first chart that you can see below is known as a line chart, and is commonly plotted using the closing prices of each period by default.

You can change this in the settings to reflect the average price for the period or the opening price, but I find it is often best to use the default settings, as this is what the majority of traders will see.

Line charts are a useful chart when carrying out your initial analysis, as a lot of the noise is removed, making support and resistance zones, as well as chart patterns clearer to see. Support and Resistance zones help identify the current trading range of an instrument, and these zones will be explained further in Module 2 Section 1.

The closing price that is plotted is relative to the timeframe you are on, so a 1-hour chart will plot the close price of each hour, and a daily chart will plot the close price of each day. This allows you to view both short-term and longer-term ranges dependent on your trading objectives.However, it also simplifies the data, so you are not seeing the full picture. That is why other charts should then be utilised.

**1.12 Candle Charts**

The next chart you can then reference is called a candle chart, and this is one of the most common charts available on most trading platforms. These charts convey much more information than a line chart and therefore provide a deeper and richer view, but more on this later.

Each of the candles on the chart represents the period of the timeframe of that chart.

For example, if you are on a 15-minute chart, each candle represents a 15-minute period and on a 1-hour chart, each candle represents one hour.

It is important to understand which timeframe you are looking at, as the different timeframes will look completely different when compared to each other, even though you are looking at the same trading instrument.

As an example, the 5-minute chart on the EURUSD currency pair will look completely different to the EURUSD daily chart, even though both charts are being formed by the most current price information.

**1.13 Bar Charts**

The last of the charts that we will look at is a bar chart pictured below. Again, each of the bars that you see on the chart represents the period of the timeframe the chart is set to. Bars and candles are formed using the same information, and form patterns that look identical when they are viewed side by side.

Whether you are looking at a line chart, candle chart or a bar chart, all of the price information of the instrument you are trading, such as currencies, commodities, futures or stock are represented in the same consistent way, meaning that you don’t have to change your chart analysis style for whatever you choose to trade.

**1.2 - Candle and Bar Components**

**1.21** **Candles**

Candles and bars are made up of four important pieces of information, the open price, the close price, the highest point of the range and the lowest point of the range. With this information, any candlestick or bar can be created, and each gives you important information about the price action during that timeframe. They may indicate future price movement among other things that you will learn in this module.

As you can see in the example below, the main body of the candle is contained within the open price and the closing price. If the closing price of the candle is higher than the opening price, then it is a bullish candle, and if the closing price of the candle is lower than the opening price, it is a bearish candle.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/XtcuIokAQSi4tbCKVQQr)

Some of the most common colour schemes use the colour green for a bullish candle and the colour red for a bearish candle. It is important to note that the colours you choose to make your bullish and bearish candles is for your information only, and does not affect the main components on how the candle is formed.

The area outside the main body of the candle represents the movement outside the open and close of the period, and is often referred to as the upper shadow and lower shadow. The size of this area reflects how much price action there was outside the open and close of the period, and can give you important information about how much volatility there was in that particular period.

**1.22 Bars**

Just like the components of a candle, the same information is used to form a bar.

The open price is always represented on the left hand side with a little handle, and the close is represented with the same size handle on the right hand side.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/qGeSHlzKRM6Rm8pik42O)

The distance between the low of the bar and the high of the bar is called the range, and it is this distance that provides the information you need to know about the price behaviour for that particular timeframe.

One of the great things about bar charts when compared to candle charts is that you can identify a bullish bar or a bearish bar instantly, by looking at where the handles opened and closed, and not rely on its colour.

### **1.3 - Types of Candlesticks**

Let’s now explore some of the common candle sticks you will encounter on a candle chart, and how you can go about interpreting them. There are hundreds of different candles, all with their unique name and purpose, but I like to stick to the most common and useful candles that have relevance to help you identify the next potential direction of the market.

Remember, it doesn’t matter what the name of the candle is, it is what the candle represents that is important. As long as you can interpret what the candle represents, the name or colour becomes irrelevant.

**1.31 Long-Range and Short-Range Candles**

Range Candles (which are either long-range or short-range candles) can be identified as a candle where the body of the candle makes up the majority of the range. As you can see in the image below, the upper and lower shadow only make up a small portion of the total range.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/hEaWYA2kTDafOahEuy9J)

==A good way to take the ambiguity out of what constitutes a range candle is to apply a scale similar to the example below. If the upper and lower shadows are less than 20% of the overall range, then you can refer to this candle as a range candle.==

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/HFwFw12GRb6wdQ2z9cHj)

Now the best way to determine if the candle you are analysing is a long-range or short-range candle is by comparing it to adjacent candles on the chart you are analysing. It would be difficult to apply a scale to determine the length of candles because of different timeframes and trading instruments, but you can certainly compare them to the previous candles which will give you the information you need to understand what is happening to the price of an instrument.

For example, if you viewed the candles on the right in isolation, you could not determine if they are long-range or short-range candles, but when you look at them as a group, it is easy to see that the candles on the right have only half the range of the candles on the left.

Although the range candles give you important information about what price has done recently, the next group of candles provide important information about what the market may do next.

**1.32 Hammer Candles**

The candles in the example below are called hammer candles, and they can be used to identify a possible reversal of a downtrend. From what you already know about the candle make up, you can see that the open of the hammer candle is close to the top of the range of the period, as is the close.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/MmOSNNnTfiHvmSZTt2YA)

It is what price does throughout the hammer candle that makes it significant. To explain the importance of the hammer candle, let’s break down every stage.

Looking at the chart we know the market is in a downtrend by the fact that the recent candles have been bearish. At the start of the hammer candle, this trend looks set to continue, with the open being lower than the previous close, and the sellers pushing the price down, extending the range of the candle.

Sometime throughout the period of this candle, the buyers have regained control, and by the end of the period, the candle has closed close to or on the high of the period.

The price action in the hammer candle displays a significant shift in momentum from sellers having control and pushing price lower, to buyers seizing control and completely reversing the actions of the sellers.

In isolation, a hammer candle is not so significant but when it forms after a series of bearish candles, it may help signal a reversal in a downtrend.

It is important to note that with a hammer candle, as with all candles and candle patterns, the larger the timeframe, the more significant the signal.

For example, a hammer on a five minute chart wouldn’t be regarded as important, but a hammer on a weekly chart is extremely significant, as it represents the selling and buying behaviour for an entire week.

**1.33 Shooting Star Candles**

The candles in the example below are known as shooting star candles, and can be used to identify a possible reversal in an uptrend. The open of the shooting star candle is close to the low of the range of the period, and the close is at or very near the low of the period.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/ch4scbPWTUyKN3JeeaPE)

To highlight the importance of this candle, let’s again look at every stage of its formation.

You know the market is in an uptrend by the fact that the recent candles have been bullish. At the start of the shooting star candle, this trend looks set to continue, with the open being higher than the previous close, and the buyers pushing the price up, extending the range of the candle.

Sometime throughout the period of this candle, the sellers have regained control, and by the end of the period, the candle has closed close to or on the low of the period.

The price action in the shooting star candle has displayed a significant shift in momentum from the buyers having control and pushing price higher, to the sellers seizing control and completely reversing the actions of the buyers.

In isolation, a shooting star candle is not so significant, but when it forms after a series of bullish candles, it may help signal a reversal in an uptrend.

To remove any ambiguity as to whether the candle is a hammer or shooting star, you can apply a similar scale to the one used earlier.

---

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/v4xEfaFGTH6LPOfzcgZc)

For a candle to be a valid hammer, the open and the close must be above 80% of the total range of the candle.

Similarly, for a candle to be a valid shooting star, the open and the close must be below 20% of the total range of the candle.

**1.34 The Doji Candlesticks**

As you are analysing a Candlestick chart you will come across what are known as Doji candles. These can be used to identify key turning points in a trending or range bound market. The image illustrates the most important type of doji candles.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/AP1A1cj6RxCI8BkJ76oe)

The long legged doji is a type of candlestick formation where the opening and closing prices are close to being equal around the centre of the range, despite a lot of price movement throughout the trading period. This often signals indecision about the future direction of price.

The gravestone doji is a candlestick that forms when the opening and closing prices are close to being equal, and occur at the low of the period. The long upper shadow indicates that the periods’ buying power was matched by the sellers, and is commonly interpreted to suggest that the direction of the trend may reverse.

The dragonfly doji is a candlestick that forms when the opening and closing prices are equal and occur around the high of the period. The long lower shadow indicates that the level of buyers and sellers are nearing a balance, and that the direction of the trend may reverse.

Like most things in the trading markets, levels are very rarely exact, so a scale can also be used to identify these important candles.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/Zr4zqXSTSTuwruyoaJfy)

A long legged doji can be validated when the open and the close of the candle is between the 40% and 60% levels of the total range of the period.

A gravestone doji can be validated when the open and the close of the candle is between 0 and 20% of the bottom of the total range of the period.

A dragonfly doji can be validated when the open and the close of the candle is between the 80% and 100% of the top of the total range of the period.

**1.4 - Interpreting Bar Closes**

Similar to candles, the opens and closes of bars provide certain information that can be used to help determine the dynamics between buyers and sellers.

![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/du6cpauxSaiKPBCnTtDX)

As the examples above demonstrate, the relevance of the close price is directly related to where the opening price is on the range of the bar, and although they appear similar to some of the candle patterns, they display a different type of dynamic.
